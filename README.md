This project is a university-level implementation of a responsive user interface (UI) framework designed for C++ applications. It consists of multiple components, including window management, layout control, and labelling, each crafted to dynamically adjust the UI layout based on screen dimensions and user preferences. Key modules involve responsive_window, responsive_layout, and responsive_label, which collectively provide the foundation for a flexible and adaptable UI experience. This modular approach enables efficient UI responsiveness, supporting diverse device types and resolutions.

Additional features include a screenshot module to capture and document UI states, adding to the versatility and robustness of this responsive UI solution. This framework is a practical solution for developing modern C++ applications that require adaptable UIs without compromising performance or visual integrity.
